			<h1>Andy's Life!!!</h1>
				<p>
					When a house of love, <br />
					Get's torn away from you, <br />
					Storms in your heart will brew, <br />
					Filling your mind with teardrops.
				</p>
				<p>
					With hair that resembles acorns, <br />
					A spotty jumper complete with mulberry stains, <br />
					This tall teenage girl, <br />
					Has jeans ripped by the knees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her thoughts filled with anger and fear, <br />
					She wants to go back to the cottage she holds dear, <br />
					In her eyes are sparks full with determination, <br />
					To sow the rip in her family back together.
